Many issues appear in the support channels because of a misunderstanding of the use of these utilities. And through discussion at Virtual Universe Office Hours it was determined that these tools probably serve no useful purpose anymore.

Instead of removing them immediately, we move them here, for a time, in case there is a useful purpose that has escaped us during conversations.

If a need to compile these arises, the Universe.32BitLaunch and Robust.32BitLaunch directories may be placed under the ./Universe/Tools sources subdirectory, run the prebuild script and compile.
