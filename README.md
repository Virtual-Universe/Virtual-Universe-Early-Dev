# Virtual-Universe-Early-Dev
Virtual-Universe-Early-Dev is the early development stage repository of Virtual Universe Open Source Project Arm.

Likewise the code in this repository is considered very unstable and only the faint of heart should use this code for testing purposes only.  Please do not use this repository to run a production level grid.
