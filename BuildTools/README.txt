All files you need to contribute to Virtual Universe go here.

Properties\AssemblyInfo.cs - the Properties\AssemblyInfo.cs folder and file are to be added for each new project that is created.  We will not accept contributions that create a new project without these.

EmptyClass.cs - The EmptyClass.cs contains a copy of the license that must go at the top of each new file your contribution creates.  Please use this file when creating new projects so the license stays uniform.  When a new license must be added because you are porting something in from a third party project then save a copy of that license called ProjectNameLicense.license (Replace ProjectName with the project's actual name).  For example if you submit code coming from a project named JohnDoe you would change the file name ProjectNameLicense.license to JohnDoeLicense.license and add that file to the two Licenses directories as part of your proosed commit.
