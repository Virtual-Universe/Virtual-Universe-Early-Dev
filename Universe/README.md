# Universe

This directory is for the source code of the new Virtual Universe.  The directories are as follows:

- Universe/Core - All the core code required for Virtual Universe to run goes here.  The code in this directory cannot be removed without breaking Virtual Universe
- Universe/Optional - Contains modules that are able to be removed without breaking Virtual Universe.  This modular approach will allow grids to be customized based on what they need and want to set them apart from other grids.
