    ;; However, they do rely on the server to tell them whether it's Daylight Saving Time or not.
    ;; Hence, calculating DST based on a different timezone can result in a misleading viewer display and inconsistencies between grids.
    ;; By default, this setting uses various timezone names to calculate DST with regards to the viewer's standard PST.
    ;; Options are
    ;;   "none"     no DST
    ;;   "local"    use the server's only timezone to calculate DST.  This is previous Universeulator behaviour.
    ;;   "America/Los_Angeles;Pacific Standard Time" use these timezone names to look up Daylight savings.
